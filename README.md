# Time-Series-Sales-Forecasting

**Time Series Sales Forecasting**: A project that leverages time series and causal models such as ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Linear Regression to forecast product sales and identify trends for data-driven decision-making.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods (i.e., Time Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast product sales using historical data. The project involved:
- Performing time series analysis to identify patterns and trends in sales data.
- Applying multiple forecasting models on the training dataset.
- Selecting the best-performing model to forecast sales on the test data.

### Models Covered:
1. **Seasonal Naive Model**
2. **Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)**
3. **ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models**
4. **Linear Regression Model**

## Performance Metrics:
The following metrics were used to evaluate and compare the performance of each forecasting model:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Indicates the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides a measure of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Assesses the accuracy of forecasts as a percentage.

By leveraging these models and metrics, the project aimed to improve forecasting accuracy and provide valuable insights into sales trends and future demand.
